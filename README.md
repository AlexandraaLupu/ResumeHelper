# ResumeHelper
- A team project made for the RPA course at University using UiPath.
- An automation designed to optimize the process of reviewing received CVs by matching certain qualities against a list of 'Nice to have' and 'Minimum requirements'.
- The CVs are received by email and checked to ensure they contain only one PDF. Afterward, the process of reading the PDF and matching the terms begins. The program sends emails to the manager if a candidate's score exceeds expectations and notifies the team of any errors via email.


My role in the project involved checking received emails to ensure the CVs were in the correct format and sending an email to the team to notify them of any business exceptions. The process checks all the unread emails, one by one.
The emails, passwords and paths are stored in assets in Orchestrator.
I also integrated my teammates' tasks into the REFramework.
